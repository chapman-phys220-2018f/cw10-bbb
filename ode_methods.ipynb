Uses equation of a tangent line to graph unknown functions by finding the initial value of each tanget line. This method applies the gradient $u_k$ to $u_{k-1}$ twice as opposed to once in the Euler's method. Because the Leapfrog Method can only begin iterating at $u_{k-1}$, you would have to find $u_1$ using the Euler's method first, and applying that to the Leapfrog Method to find $u_{1+k}$."
